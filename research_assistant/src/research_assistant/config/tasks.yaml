    You are tasked with creating a set of 3 distinct subtopics that will be assigned to 3
    AI analysts.
    Each subtopic should be directly related to the main topic {topic} and have detailed
    content and descriptions. 
    That is, it should address a subtopic of the central theme {topic}, with a unique 
    subtopic for each analyst.

    Follow these instructions carefully:

    1. First, review the research topic:
    {topic}

    2. Each subtopic should be a subtopic and related to {topic}.

    3. Determine the most interesting subtopics based on the documents found.

    4. Choose the main subtopics, considering we have 3 Analysts.

    5. Assign an Analyst to each subtopic.
  expected_output: >
    The output should consist of three subtopics with detailed content and descriptions to allow analysts to ask questions using their detailed content and descriptions.
    Each subtopic should always have a header named after the analyst responsible for the subtopic.
    Example:
    Subtopic for Analyst 1:
    "Improved Decision-Making xxxxx xxx xxxx  ...."
    Subtopic for Analyst 2:
    "xxxx xxxx  ...."
